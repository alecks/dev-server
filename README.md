# dev-server

A simple development server for personal use. I somehow find myself writing a new server every time I make a static site, so this should fix that.

This really isn't intended for use other than my own, but nothing's stopping you from running it yourself.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen] 2.0.0 or above installed.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
